  This is a rather long paragraph to show the text-wrapping supported by the
  ASCII and Markdown exporters. Applications integrating FTML support should "do
  the right thing" regarding breaking lines in paragraphs. This could mean that
  the full available width of the window or screen is used, or that the lines
  are broken to limit the number of characters per line to a specific number.
  FTML itself <i>does not</i> encorce any specific rules here, the included
  Markdown exporter does wrap at 80 characters, though.
