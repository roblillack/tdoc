# Comprehensive Gemini Test Document

This document tests all major Gemini features.

## Text Formatting

Regular paragraph text appears without any special markers.

Multiple paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

## Headings

We have three levels of headings (shown above and below).

### Third Level Heading

This is under a third-level heading.

## Links

=> https://gemini.circumlunar.space/ Project Gemini
=> gemini://example.com/page.gmi Example Gemini Page
=> /local/path/file.gmi Local File
=> https://example.com

## Lists

* First list item
* Second list item
* Third list item with more text
* Fourth and final item

## Quotes

> This is a blockquote in Gemini format.
> It can span multiple lines.
> Each line starts with a greater-than sign.

## Preformatted Text

```
This is preformatted text (code block).
It preserves    spacing   and formatting.

def example():
    return "Hello, Gemini!"
```

```python
# You can optionally specify alt text after the backticks
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Mixed Content

Here's a paragraph followed by a link:

=> https://example.org Example Organization

And then another paragraph with more content.

* List item one
* List item two

> A quote to finish things off.

That's all!
