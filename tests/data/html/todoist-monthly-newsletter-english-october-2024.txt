The Todoist Monthly

All that’s new in the Todoist-verse – October 2024

Manage your time-blocked Todoist to-dos like Review client proposals at
2pm for 2h or Pick up Garfield from the vet at 10am for 30m more
efficiently by syncing those tasks directly to your Google Calendar –
available on all plans!

Your to-dos and events all in one place

Now, you’ll be able to see your Todoist tasks right in line with your
dentist appointments, board meetings, game nights, and whatever other
fun things you’ve got going on. This’ll help you make realistic plans
and avoid overcommitting yourself (music to all our adulting ears,
right?).

Let    Francesca show you how to start syncing:



How it works

Syncing tasks to Google Calendar is incredibly easy to set up (easier
than, say, coaxing Garfield into the car for his vet appointment).

 • If you haven’t done so already, first head to Calendar settings to
   connect Todoist to your Google Calendar account. Click Connect Google
   Calendar and follow the flow.

 • Once you’re connected to Google Calendar, flip the toggle at the
   bottom of Calendar settings to enable the Sync tasks to calendar
   option.

 • Within seconds, you’ll see a “Todoist” calendar appear in your Google
   Calendar account.

Open Todoist

With the Sync tasks to calendar feature turned on, Todoist will
automatically sync all your tasks with a due date and time or duration
to Google Calendar, including scheduled tasks in shared projects that
have been assigned to you. And when plans change – as they inevitably do
– you can conveniently reschedule your tasks directly from Google
Calendar, saving you from unnecessary app hopping.

Check out our help center article for more details on syncing Todoist
with Google Calendar. (Or, watch Francesca’s demo – she explains it
thoroughly halfway through.)

See your tasks turn into triumphs

Once a task has been completed, watch it transform in your calendar with
a charming ✓ check mark. It’s a satisfying way to see your
accomplishments at a glance!

What’s next? (Hint: It starts with O and ends with look) 👀

Our journey with calendars doesn’t stop with Google.

You guessed it – we’re diligently working on a new Outlook Calendar
integration that’ll bring the joy of time-blocking to all you Outlook
enthusiasts. We’ll also be exploring ways to display completed tasks
within the calendar layout in Todoist, so you can easily track your
achievements over time.

In the meantime, let us know what you think of the new Sync tasks
feature. We’d love to hear from you as we continue to refine the
calendar experience in Todoist.

See you next month! 👋

Productively,
