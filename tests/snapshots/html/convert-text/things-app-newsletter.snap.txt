Hi there,

Things has been updated with support for macOS Sonoma, iOS 17, and
watchOS 10. The update also includes a variety of great improvements for
widgets.

The widgets are now interactive, which means you can complete to-dos
right from the Home Screen on your iPhone or iPad. You can also place
widgets on your iPad’s Lock Screen, and even your Mac’s desktop.

Of course, Things also supports new system features like the iPhone’s
StandBy mode and the Apple Watch’s Smart Stack.

You can learn more about all the new features on our blog:

What’s New for Mac ¹



Things 3.19 is available on the App Store as a free update for all our
customers (Mac¹, iPad¹, iPhone¹). The new features also require that you
update to the latest versions of macOS, iOS, and watchOS.

We hope you enjoy this update! 🙂
