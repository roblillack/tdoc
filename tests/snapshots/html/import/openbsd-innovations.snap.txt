Concepts
--------

 • ipsec(4)¹: Started by John Ioannidis, Angelos D. Keromytis, Niels
   Provos, and Niklas Hallqvist, imported February 20, 1997. OpenBSD was
   the first free operating system to provide an IPSec stack.

 • inet6(4)²: First complete integration and adoption of IPv6 led by
   "Itojun" (Dr. Junichiro Hagino) [WIDE/KAME], Craig Metz [NRL], and
   Angelos D. Keromytis starting Jan 6, 1999. Almost fully operational
   Jun 6, 1999 during the first OpenBSD hackathon³. OpenBSD 2.7.

 • Privilege separation: First implemented by Niels Provos⁴ and Markus
   Friedl in OpenSSH in March 2002, released with OpenBSD 3.2. The
   concept is now used in many OpenBSD programs, for example bgpd(8)⁵,
   dhclient(8)⁶, dhcpd(8)⁷, dvmrpd(8)⁸, eigrpd(8)⁹, file(1)¹⁰,
   httpd(8)¹¹, iked(8)¹², ldapd(8)¹³, ldpd(8)¹⁴, mountd(8)¹⁵,
   npppd(8)¹⁶, ntpd(8)¹⁷, ospfd(8)¹⁸, ospf6d(8)¹⁹, pflogd(8)²⁰,
   radiusd(8)²¹, relayd(8)²², ripd(8)²³, script(1)²⁴, smtpd(8)²⁵,
   syslogd(8)²⁶, tcpdump(8)²⁷, tmux(1)²⁸, xconsole(1)²⁹, xdm(1)³⁰,
   Xserver(1)³¹, ypldap(8)³², pkg_add(1)³³, etc.

 • Privilege revocation: Related to the work on privilege separation,
   some programs were refactored to drop privileges while holding onto a
   tricky resource such as a raw socket, reserved port, or
   modification-locked bpf(4) descriptor, for example ping(8)³⁴,
   traceroute(8)³⁵, etc.

 • Stack protector: Developed since 2001 as "propolice" by Hiroaki Etoh.
   Integrated, and implemented for additional hardware platforms, by
   Federico G. Schwindt, Miod Vallat and Theo de Raadt. OpenBSD 3.3 was
   the first operating system to enable it systemwide by default.

 • W^X: First used for sparc, sparc64, alpha, and hppa in OpenBSD 3.3.
   Strictly enforced by default since OpenBSD 6.0: a program can only
   violate it if the executable is marked with PT_OPENBSD_WXNEEDED and
   it is located on a filesystem mounted with the wxallowed mount(8)³⁶
   option.

 • GOT and PLT protection by ld.so: first done as part of the W^X work
   in OpenBSD 3.3, by Dale Rahn and Theo de Raadt. The GOT and PLT
   regions are read-only outside of ld.so itself. Extended to the
   .init/.fini sections (constructors and destructors) in OpenBSD 3.4.

 • ASLR: OpenBSD 3.4 was the first widely used operating system to
   provide it by default.

 • gcc-local(1)³⁷ __attribute__((__bounded__)) static analysis
   annotation and checking mechanism: Started by Anil Madhavapeddy on
   June 26, 2003 and ported to GCC 4 by Nicholas Marriott. First
   released with OpenBSD 3.4.

 • malloc(3)³⁸ randomization implemented by Thierry Deval. Guard pages
   and randomized (delayed) free added by Ted Unangst. Reimplemented by
   Otto Moerbeek³⁹ for OpenBSD 4.4.

 • Position-independent executables (PIE): OpenBSD 5.3 was the first
   widely used operating system to enable it globally by default, on
   seven hardware platforms. Implemented in November 2008 by Kurt
   Miller⁴⁰ and enabled by default by Pascal Stumpf⁴¹ in August 2012.

 • Random-data memory: the ability to specify that a variable should be
   initialized at load time with random byte values (placed into a new
   ELF .openbsd.randomdata section) was implemented in OpenBSD 5.3 by
   Matthew Dempsky.

 • Stack protector per shared object: using the random-data memory
   feature, each shared object was given its own stack protector cookie
   in OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.

 • Static-PIE: Position-independent static binaries for /bin, /sbin and
   ramdisks. Implemented for OpenBSD 5.7 by Kurt Miller and Mark
   Kettenis.

 • SROP (sigreturn(2)⁴² oriented programming) mitigation: attacks
   researched by Eric Bosman⁴³ and Herbert Bos in 2014, solution
   implemented by Theo de Raadt in May 2016, enabled by default since
   OpenBSD 6.0.

 • Library order randomization: In rc(8)⁴⁴, re-link libc.so, libcrypto,
   and ld.so on startup, placing the objects in a random order. Theo de
   Raadt and Robert Peichaer, May 2016, enabled by default since OpenBSD
   6.0 and 6.2.

 • Kernel-assisted lazy-binding for W^X safety in multi-threaded
   programs. A new syscall kbind(2)⁴⁵ permits lazy-binding to be W^X
   safe in multi-threaded programs. Implemented for OpenBSD 5.9 by
   Philip Guenther in July 2015.

 • Process layouts in memory tightened to remove execute permission from
   all segmented, non-instruction data and to remove write permission
   from data that is only modified during loading and relocation. By
   combining the RELRO (Read-Only after Relocation) design from the GNU
   project with the original ASLR work from OpenBSD 3.3 and strict
   lazy-binding work from OpenBSD 5.9, this is applied to not just a
   subset of programs and libraries but rather to all programs and
   libraries. Implemented for OpenBSD 6.1 by Philip Guenther in August
   2016.

 • Use of fork+exec in privilege separated programs. The strategy is to
   give each process a fresh & unique address space for ASLR, stack
   protector -- as protection against address space discovery attacks.
   Implemented first by Damien Miller (sshd(8)⁴⁶ 2004), Claudio Jeker
   (bgpd(8)⁵, 2015), Eric Faurot (smtpd(8)²⁵, 2016), Rafael Zalamena
   (various, 2016), and others.

 • trapsleds: Reduction of incidental NOP instructions/sequences in the
   instruction stream which could be useful potentially for ROP attack
   methods to inaccurately target gadgets. These NOP sequences are
   converted into trap sequences where possible. Todd Mortimer and Theo
   de Raadt, June 2017.

 • Kernel relinking at boot: the .o files of the kernel are relinked in
   random order from a link-kit, before every reboot. This provides
   substantial interior randomization in the kernel's text and data
   segments for layout and relative branches/calls. Basically a unique
   address space for each kernel boot, similar to the userland fork+exec
   model described above but for the kernel. Theo de Raadt, June 2017.

 • Rearranged i386/amd64 register allocator order in clang(1)⁴⁷ to
   reduce polymorphic RET instructions: Todd Mortimer, November 20,
   2017.

 • Reencoding of i386/amd64 instruction sequences to avoid embedded
   polymorphic RET instructions. Enhancements to clang(1)⁴⁷ Todd
   Mortimer, April 28, 2018 and onwards.

 • MAP_STACK addition to mmap(2)⁴⁸ allows opportunistic verification
   that the stack-register points at stack memory, therefore catching
   pivots to non-stack memory (sometimes used in ROP attacks). Theo de
   Raadt, April 12, 2018.

 • RETGUARD is a replacement for the stack-protector which uses a
   per-function random cookie (located in the read-only ELF
   .openbsd.randomdata section) to consistency-check the return address
   on the stack. Implemented for amd64 and arm64 by Todd Mortimer in
   OpenBSD 6.4, for mips64 in OpenBSD 6.7, and powerpc/powerpc64 in
   OpenBSD 6.9. amd64 system call stubs also protected in OpenBSD 7.3.

 • MAP_CONCEAL addition to mmap(2)⁴⁸ disallows memory pages to be
   written to core dumps, preventing accidental exposure of private
   information. Theo de Raadt, Mark Kettenis and Scott Soule Cheloha,
   February 2, 2019.

 • Similar to the opportunistic verification in MAP_STACK, system-calls
   can no longer be performed from PROT_WRITE memory. Theo de Raadt,
   June 2, 2019.

 • System calls may only be performed from selected code regions (main
   program, ld.so, libc.so, and sigtramp). The libc.so region is setup
   by msyscall(2)⁴⁹. Theo de Raadt, November 28, 2019.
   This mechanism was removed because later work on immutable memory +
   pinned system calls was even better.

 • Permissions (RWX, MAP_STACK, etc) on address space regions can be
   made immutable, so that mmap(2)⁴⁸, mprotect(2)⁵⁰ or munmap(2)⁵¹ fail
   with EPERM. Most of the program static address space is now
   automatically immutable (main program, ld.so, main stack, load-time
   shared libraries, and dlopen()'d libraries mapped without
   RTLD_NODELETE). Programmers can request non-immutable static data
   using the "openbsd.mutable" section, or manually bring immutability
   to (page aligned heap objects) using mimmutable(2)⁵². Theo de Raadt,
   Dec 4, 2022.

 • sshd random relinking at boot. Theo de Raadt. Jan 18, 2023.

 • Some architectures now have non-readable code ("xonly"), both from
   the perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel
   trying to read memory in a system call. Many sloppy practices in
   userland code had to be repaired to allow this. The linker option
   --execute-only is enabled by default. In order of development: arm64,
   riscv64, hppa, amd64, powerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon. sparc64
   (sun4u only, unfinished). Mark Kettenis, Theo de Raadt, Visa Hankala,
   Miod Vallat, Dave Voutila, George Koehler in kernel and base, and
   Theo Buehler, Robert Nagy, Christian Weisgerber in ports. Dec 2022 -
   Feb 2023, still ongoing.

 • On all architectures which lack hardware-enforcement of xonly, system
   calls are now prevented from reading (via copyin/copyinst) inside the
   program's main text, ld.so text, sigtramp text, or libc.so text. Theo
   de Raadt, Jan 2023.

 • Architectures which lack xonly mmu-enforcement can still benefit from
   switching to --execute-only binaries if the cpu generates different
   traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch. The VM system will not
   allow memory to be read before it was executed which is valuable
   together with library relinking. Architectures switched over include
   loongson. Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023.

 • ld.so and crt0 register the location of the execve(2)⁵³ libc syscall
   stub with the kernel using pinsyscall(2)⁵⁴, after which the kernel
   only accepts an execve call from that specific location. Theo de
   Raadt, Feb 2023. Made redundant by pinsyscalls(2)⁵⁵ which handles all
   system calls.

 • Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets (BTI on arm64, IBT
   on Intel amd64), unless a linker flag (-Wl,-z,nobtcfi) requests no
   enforcement.

 • The kernel and ld.so register the precise entry location of every
   system call used by a program, as described in the new ELF section
   .openbsd.syscalls inside ld.so and libc.so. ld.so uses the new
   syscall pinsyscalls(2)⁵⁵ to tell the kernel the precise entry
   location of system calls in libc.so. Since all syscall entries are
   now known to the kernel, the pininsyscall(SYS_execve) interface
   becomes redundant. msyscall(2)⁴⁹ mechanism also becomes redundant
   (and is removed a bit later), because immutable memory + pinsyscalls
   together are cheaper and more effective targeting. Theo de Raadt, Jan
   2024.

 • -fret-clean is a clang extension that, upon return from a function
   cleans the return value off the stack (one of many information leaks
   which can be used to determine where functions in a different DSO
   reside). The kernel, libc, libcrypto, and ld.so(1) are compiled with
   this option. amd64 only, for now.
