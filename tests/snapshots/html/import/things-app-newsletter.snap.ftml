  Hi there,<br />
  <br />
  Things has been updated with support for macOS Sonoma, iOS 17, and watchOS
  10. The update also includes a variety of <b>great improvements for widgets</b>.
</p>

<p>
  The widgets are now interactive, which means you can complete to-dos right
  from the Home Screen on your iPhone or iPad. You can also place widgets on
  your iPad’s Lock Screen, and even your Mac’s desktop.<br />
  <br />
  Of course, Things also supports new system features like the iPhone’s StandBy
  mode and the Apple Watch’s Smart Stack.<br />
  <br />
  You can learn more about all the new features on our blog:&emsp14;
