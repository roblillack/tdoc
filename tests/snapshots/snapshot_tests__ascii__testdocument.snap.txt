                    This is an example FTML document



The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the following use-cases:

 • Describe the features supported by FTML.

 • Showcase the FTML standard formatting enforced by fmtftml.



Supported features
==================


Inline styles
-------------

The following inline styles are supported in FTML:

 • Bold text.

 • Italic text.

 • Highlighted text.

 • Underlined text.

 • Striked text.

 • Text formatted as code.


Text paragraphs
---------------

This is a rather long paragraph to show the text-wrapping supported by
the ASCII and Markdown exporters. Applications integrating FTML support
should “do the right thing” regarding breaking lines in paragraphs. This
could mean that the full available width of the window or screen is
used, or that the lines are broken to limit the number of characters per
line to a specific number. FTML itself does not encorce any specific
rules here, the included Markdown exporter does wrap at 80 characters,
though.


Quoted paragraphs
-----------------

| Like any other blocks, quotes may contain any of the different
| paragraph types as children. First, let's look into wrapping of
| quotes, though. As you can see, this is a very long line again.
| 
| This is the second paragraph of the very same quote. This paragraph,
| too, will be broken into multiple lines, if necessary.
| 
| 
| Quoted Headers
| --------------
| 
| As expected, you'll be able to quote all kinds of paragraphs—including
| section headers.
| 
| | Now, finally, let's look at a second level quote. Like expected,
| | this paragraph will also wrap at the same width, even if if it
| | indented further then the paragraphs above.


Bullet points
-------------

TBD

Example:

 • This is a bullet point.

 • This is another bullet point.
   
   Contrasting to the first bullet point, this one contains multiple
   paragraps, with this one being the second one.

 • This is a bullet point with a bunch of hard line breaks.

 • | This bulletpoint contains a quote.


Paragraph nesting
-----------------

FTML supports nesting of paragraphs, so this is entirely possible:

| Please see, how the following list is part of a quote and contains
| nested paragraphs.
| 
|  • This is a paragraph inside of a quoted paragraph
| 
|  • This bullet points contains another quote:
|    
|    | You can never have enough nesting of paragraphs.

Whitespace and line-break handling
==================================


This is a line with a hard line-break:
First line
Second line.

This is a line with multiple line-breaks:
First line

Second line.

This is a line with multiple spaces:
A B

| This is a paragraph that contains a very long line of highlighted text
| to force the formatter to break
| the
| line
| in the middle. But afterwards, of course, things should continue
| normally.



Unicode support
===============


The following three tests check for the word wrapping to break at the
right spot.

72 ASCII characters:

######## ######## ######## ######## ######## ######## ######## ########.

=======================================================================^

8 Unicode multi-byte characters, 64 ASCII chars:

cafébabe cafébabe cafébabe cafébabe cafébabe cafébabe cafébabe cafébabe.

=======================================================================^

32 double-with emoji, 7 spaces, 1 dot:

😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎 😎😎😎😎.
